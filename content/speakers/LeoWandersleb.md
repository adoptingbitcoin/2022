# Leo Wandersleb
 
Leo is a Mathematician from Munich, Germany, currently living in Chile who's been dabbling in Bitcoin for a long time. For five years as a wallet developer and release manager he saw problems with most wallets out there and started his project WalletScrutiny.com to raise awareness for those. After a generous donation he turned his focus to WalletScrutiny full time last year.
