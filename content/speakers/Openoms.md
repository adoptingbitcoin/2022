<b>Lightning Privacy Panel</b><br><br>
Privacy is a fundamental human right, essential to autonomy and the protection of human dignity, serving as the foundation upon which many other human rights are built. If intrusive surveillance companies are allowed to continue their malpractices with further adoption of Bitcoin, this could become a threat to personal safety, human dignity, the operation of a free market and ultimately, a free society. This panel will discuss privacy of the on-chain footprint and privacy of the off-chain payments in the light of most recent technological developments like Taproot, Schnorr, PTLCs, Coinjoins, Trampoline and Swaps, as well as what areas need further development and resources.<br><br>
