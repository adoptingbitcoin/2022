# John Carvalho
 
John Carvalho is a 9-year Bitcoin veteran that has been a staunch defender of "toxic" Bitcoin Maximalist ideals, while participating in the full spectrum of Bitcoin communities, projects, and events. In March 2020, John left his role as CCO at Bitrefill, the most successful international Bitcoin e-commerce company in the world, to pursue a new vision for Bitcoin. At Bitrefill, he helped promote the Lightning Network from its earliest days, including working with Bitfinex to become the first major exchange to add Lightning support. For the past 20 months, John has been working as CEO at a new, stealth-mode company to research, design, and develop cutting-edge technology and products for Bitcoin that will pave the way for a post-hyperbitcoinized social economy.
