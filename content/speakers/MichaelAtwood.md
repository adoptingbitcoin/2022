# Michael Atwood
 
Michael Atwood is from Oshi, a hyper-verticalized local promotions marketplace. His take on Bitcoin and Lightning is that the combination of both will s‪upercharge millions of small businesses on a global scale rather sooner than we might think - Bitcoin Beach is an example for that.

## Day 1 | ECON Track | 5:05 - 5:30
<br>
<i>Taking local commerce off-the-chain</i><br><br>
Local commerce is literally going off-the-chain (layer 2), and figuratively (it's going to be amazing). Michael will lay out his thesis on how lightning network ushers in a true e-commerce revolution for small businesses and consumers all over the world, lowers the 'costs of doing business', preserves community wealth, and empowers consumers, businesses, and local economies in ways that make sense, and sats, for everyone involved. Data will be provided backing this thesis, along with real-world examples of negative second and third order effects processing fees have on local economies that are easy to overlook. Additionally, he'll share insights surrounding lightning for ecommerce in both developed and developing economies. How to pitch it, success stories perhaps, etc. Bitcoin beach and El Salvador has inspired millions of people all over the world. There's no reason why people can't take small steps to foster the development of a 'bitcoin beach' in their community.<br><br>
