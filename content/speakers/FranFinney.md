# Fran Finney
 
Fran Finney's husband Hal Finney was one of the first supporters of bitcoin when Nakamoto floated it on a cryptography mailing list. On January 10, 2009 he famously tweeted: “Running bitcoin”. Two days later he received the first bitcoin transaction for 10 BTC from Satoshi in block 170. On August 5, 2009, Hal was diagnosed with ALS. He lived valiantly with ALS for 5 more years, and passed away in August, 2014. Join the “Running Bitcoin Challenge” January 1-10 to raise funds for the Golden West Chapter of the ALS Association in honor of legendary cypherpunk, Hal Finney. More information on the links below.
