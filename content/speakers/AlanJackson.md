Alan is an international corporate pilot, prolific orange piller and Bitcoin evangelist. Father of four, avid promoter of Bitcoin adoption from the ground up through strong grass-roots involvement in the local Meet Up group. He has orange pilled friends in multiple countries and is looking for opportunities to foster the adoption of Bitcoin everywhere he travels. A close Bitcoin Podcaster friend told him once: "We only need 500 Alans around the world and bitcoin would be the standard in a year."
