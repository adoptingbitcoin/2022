# Ben Bean
 
Ben is a English-Spanish bilingual teacher and coach looking to foster intercultural communication between Salvadorans and Americans. As Bitcoin globalizes, the impact of language will play a pivotal role in opportunistic partnerships.  To keep pushing the role of Bitcoin as national legal tender, strategic partnerships will be all the more valuable to connect Spanish speaking small business owners with the Bitcoin community.  There is so much opportunity for even the poorest people in El Salvador to gain access to this decentralized tender to enhance their Standard of Living.  As more and more wealthy Bitcoiners arrive in the country, it is inexcusable to leave the natives behind.
