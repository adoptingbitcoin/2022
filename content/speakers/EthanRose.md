# Ethan Rose
 
Ethan has a background in UX focused software engineering in big tech. His family ties to the Philippines got him to realize how valuable bitcoin was for the remittance use case. He would have to use various apps and pay high fees to get around sending limits to unbanked relatives. So he founded Pouch to help make bitcoin easy to use for senders and recipients alike, and ultimately to make the concept of "remittances" disappear entirely.
