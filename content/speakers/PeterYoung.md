These include Austrian wealth management firm Incrementum AG, online Austrian Economics learning platform Saifedean.com and bitcoin technology company Blockstream. Peter’s work at Blockstream has included producing content explaining how Liquid and Lightning serve as complementary layer-2 scaling solutions for Bitcoin.
