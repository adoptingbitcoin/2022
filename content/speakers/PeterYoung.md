He sees financial infrastructure based on Bitcoin as key to making the foundation’s vision for Free Private Cities a reality. Peter is interested in the Austrian School of Economics and Bitcoin, and has partnerships with businesses operating in these fields. These include Austrian wealth management firm Incrementum AG, online Austrian Economics learning platform Saifedean.com and bitcoin technology company Blockstream. Peter’s work at Blockstream has included producing content explaining how Liquid and Lightning serve as complementary layer-2 scaling solutions for Bitcoin.
