## Day 1 | DEV Track | 9:45 - 10:10
Peer Infrastructure Improvement<br><br>
In this keynote Warren Togami and Konstantin Nick will be revealing a new Open Source infrastructure project that enhances routing for all LN nodes (c-lightning and LND at first). It uses a radically different approach to reduce the difficulty and cost of channel balancing while also cutting the cost of capital for all LN nodes.
