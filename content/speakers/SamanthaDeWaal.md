# Samantha de Waal
 
Samantha has been a Bitcoiner for 11 years.  She's also 11 years old. A part of the first generation to grow up with Bitcoin in their lives, Sam sees the world from a different perspective to those of us who grew up learning about how money works in the fiat world. Samanthaâ€™s Dad - [Ben DeWaal](https://adoptingbitcoin.org/2022/speaker/BenDeWaal) - first discovered Bitcoin in 2010 and after mostly ignoring it for a year, stumbled across it again around a year later and was shocked enough that it still existed to finally start spending some time understanding it.  Ben has had several roles in the Bitcoin space and currently works as the Vice President of Engineering at Swan Bitcoin.
