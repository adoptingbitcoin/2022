# Ben de Waal
 
Ben is [Samantha](https://adoptingbitcoin.org/2022/speaker/SamanthaDeWaal)â€™s Dad -  he first discovered Bitcoin in 2010 and after mostly ignoring it for a year, stumbled across it again around a year later and was shocked enough that it still existed to finally start spending some time understanding it.  Ben has had several roles in the Bitcoin space and currently works as the Vice President of Engineering at Swan Bitcoin.
