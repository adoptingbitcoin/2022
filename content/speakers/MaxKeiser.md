# Max Keiser
 
Max Keiser is one of the earliest Bitcoin advocates. He has been preaching about Satoshi's peer to peer electronic cash system to his audiences since 2010. He has supporters all over the world and especially in LATAM where his show was broadcasted in Spanish language. Max is also the main driver of Bitcoin Derangement Syndrome - a psychological disorder found among Bitcoin deniers who cannot overcome the pain of not having listened to Max. Together with his partner Stacy Herbert, Max is hosting the "Max and Stacy Report", broadcast from El Salvador, which he has chosen as his new home.
