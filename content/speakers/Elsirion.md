<i>Improving Bitcoin Privacy with Federated E-Cash Mints</i><br><br>
Lightning, while being a huge improvement, still has a scaling, privacy and accessibility problem. Channel management is expensive and tedious, leading to many users choosing custodial services, sacrificing privacy and censorship resistance. Federated E-Cash Mints on top of Bitcoin and Lightning, based on the anonymous e-cash ideas by David Chaum, solve these problems in two ways:<br>
1 - Custodianship of the backing funds is distributed over the federation members, preventing censorship and theft by single entities<br>
2 - User access to funds is granted through anonymous e-cash tokens issued by the federation<br>
This allows for a set of not fully trusted parties (e.g. local community members) to run a semi-custodial, anonymous Lightning wallet service, fully interoperable with everyone else.
